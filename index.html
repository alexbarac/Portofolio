                      Embarking on a dynamic journey in the realm of software testing, I have cultivated a comprehensive skill set with a primary focus on Java, Selenium, Cypress, and API testing. 
                      The inception of my experience involved creating a versatile and scalable automation framework entirely from scratch. With Java as the backbone of my programming arsenal, 
                      I seamlessly integrated Selenium to navigate and interact with web applications, providing a robust testing solution for frontend scenarios. Expanding my toolkit, I delved into Cypress to enhance end-to-end testing, 
                      embracing its efficient JavaScript-based architecture for modern web applications. My expertise extends to API testing, where I have employed various tools to validate the functionality and performance of backend systems.
                      Beyond automation, I bring valuable experience in manual testing, where I have honed my attention to detail and critical thinking skills. As a Test Lead, I have successfully steered testing teams, 
                      leveraging my comprehensive understanding of testing methodologies to drive quality assurance initiatives.

                      In my journey through the dynamic field of testing various radio equipments, I have honed my skills in ensuring the robustness and reliability of communication systems. 
                      Utilizing Ixia tools, specifically Test Conductor, I conducted extensive tests to evaluate traffic between different equipments, ensuring seamless interoperability and optimal performance.
                       My exploration extended into understanding diverse protocols such as SNMP, telnet, and various network management system tools, enriching my knowledge in the intricacies of Ethernet-based communications. Additionally,
                        I undertook a hands-on initiative by creating a comprehensive testing framework from scratch using Selenium and Java. This framework specifically targets the web administration pages of radio equipments, interpreting commands 
                        from a CSV file and executing them through the Chrome driver. This approach not only streamlined the testing process but also provided a flexible and scalable solution to accommodate evolving testing needs. In a parallel effort,
                         I further contributed to the quality assurance team by developing custom testing tools using Python and GUI libraries, underscoring my commitment to enhancing efficiency and precision in the testing lifecycle.

                      In a proactive initiative, I developed a specialized tool designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing defects in train locomotives. This tool, created using Visual Basic .NET and leveraging the capabilities of an Access database, facilitated the efficient gathering of locomotive defect data. The system intelligently analyzed the collected information, identifying defects with a high occurrence rate. To enhance visibility and decision-making, the tool generated detailed PDF reports, presenting a comprehensive overview of the prevalent defects. These reports were then made available for analysis by the management team, providing valuable insights into patterns and trends. 
                      This project not only showcased my proficiency in Visual Basic .NET and database management but also demonstrated my commitment to developing practical solutions that contribute to informed decision-making in the realm of locomotive maintenance and management.

                      My experience in manual testing has been marked by a focused and meticulous approach, particularly in the realm of administration web applications for PBX, IP telephony, 
                      and Voice over IP (VoIP) systems. Delving into the intricate functionalities of these critical communication platforms, I applied a systematic testing methodology to ensure the robustness
                       and reliability of the software. Through careful exploration of the administration web application, I verified the user interface for intuitiveness and functionality, meticulously testing
                        each feature to guarantee seamless user experiences. Functionalities related to call management, system configurations, and user permissions underwent thorough scrutiny to identify and rectify any potential issues.</p>

                   I worked as junior programmer for a system of monitoring the sales by 
                   analysing with OCR the return of signed paper. The system shifted the responsibility and 
                   burden of proof from administration towards the end salesmen. 
                    The system was created with a state-of-the-art 
                    scanning and OCR engine, a multi tasking real-time analysis engine, an SQL back-end, an XML 
                    persistence layer, EXCEL and ACCESS exporter/importer, and many features pertaining to image 
                    manipulation. The system is a compiler and decompiler that operates on image streams. 
                    One of its important results is the ability to compare the emission database with that 
                    created post-factum from feedback from our process.

                      In my role as a software developer, I consistently adhere to the principle of writing well-structured code that prioritizes readability and maintainability. I believe that code is not just a set of instructions but a 
                      form of communication, and, as such, it should be comprehensible to both present and future developers. My commitment to crafting clean and organized code ensures that troubleshooting,
                       modifications, and enhancements are executed with efficiency and precision. In addition to maintaining code integrity, I actively contribute to the development process by implementing new functionalities and processes.</p>
